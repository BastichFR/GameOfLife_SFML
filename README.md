# GameOfLife SFML

This game is a graphical display of the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) and shell display in C++ language.

The Game of Life (an example of a cellular automaton) is played on an infinite two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes each turn of the game (also called a generation) depending on the statuses of that cell's 8 neighbors. Neighbors of a cell are cells that touch that cell, either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal from that cell.
